=head1 NAME

API::Discord::Connection - Combines a websocket and a REST client

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Discord sends us information over the websocket, and we send it stuff over the
REST client. Mostly.

This is used internally and probably of limited use otherwise.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $c = API::Discord::Connection.new:
        :url(wss://...),
        :$token,
    ;

    $c.closer.then({ say ":( $^a" });

    ... # other stuff

=head1 PROPERTIES
